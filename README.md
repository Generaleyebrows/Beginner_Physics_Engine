# Beginner_Physics_Engine

This project is a beginner level outlook on drag and drops. It'll focus on the usage of realistic gravity, collisions, how objects interact differently to the ground from certain angle, etc.

# Beginner Goal: drag and drop with realistic gravity

Idea: Adding collision effects on objects, starting with the ground

Idea: An option to draw a polygon that we can drag and drop

Idea: A set of objects that we can drag and drop, such as a table or a tennis ball

# Intermediate Goal: Adding universal gravity to any object, and seeing how they orbit each other

Idea: Adding attraction and repulsion on objections

Idea: Adding pivot points on objects

Idea: Adding thrusters to an object
